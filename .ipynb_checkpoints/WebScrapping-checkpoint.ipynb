I always thought I was easy to counter, and had a very particular place in the game and had to be vigilant to win, now I don’t even see a reason to play the character at all. I feel like the character simply has no power anymore.<br/><br/>Although I hate anecdotes, i think what I just had happen to me sums up the problem with Mercy.<br/><br/>Playing anubis defense, enemy pushes and catches 3 guys (lucio zarya hanzo) in grav. I have rez and valk ready so I pop valk and begin group healing. Enemy team kills them with combined fire (no ults) and... I’m left floating there. <br/><br/>Rez is a death sentance unless you’re protected <br/>Guardian angel has no speed boost so no use kiting around the enemy.<br/>Theres no one to heal, and even if there was it wouldn’t be enough.<br/>Damage boost is doubly useless; healing should almost always take priority anyway.<br/>And I have a really meh pistol with infinite ammo.<br/><br/>So for the next 14 seconds I had a riviting experience knowing how the ducks felt like in Duck Hunt by flying in a circle to contest the objective.<br/><br/>I seriously just don’t get it. Mercy has always been vulnerable on the ground, she just as vulnerable in the air, what used to be risky plays had their rewards taken away from them, and she has the lowest damage of all supports. I just don’t see any specific reason to play the character. Rez right now is just a convenience, it helps somone not have to walk all the way from spawn when your team has control of the situation or the enemy is too incompentant to stop you.</div> </div>\n",

Valk isn't a defensive ult, using it into a Grav was just asking to be punished. The truth is, Mercy has been OP for a long time, and you need to actually learn to play the character now. Valk is versatile, it can help sustain your team over a long fight or it can combo offensively. <br/> <br/>Combo Valk with Dragonblade for example. Damage boost from Valk allows Genji to swing and dash to kill 200 HP heros, and the pressure he creates provides safety for you.

Valk shouldn't counter Grav anyways, seeing as how if it did, zenyatta would be pointless. You, as mercy, have much more utility in your ult than other supports, being able to swap to a team wide damage boost and back without hesitation.<br/><br/>I think what you're missing is that Valk is no longer the reactionary ult that it once was. Use it more proactively in the fight, to ensure a healing and damage edge for your team, rather than saving it for when things get hairy.<br/><br/>And Mercy is still a really good pick on any map where Pharah is good. That combo hasn't changed in strength. Just pick her in the right situations, and recognize that her ult, though much weaker than it was before, is in a better place for the health of the game.<br/><br/>I'm sure she'll see some small tweaks, quality of life stuff, in the coming months to make her feel better.</div> </div>\n",

You want your teammates to be somewhat damaged so when valk is done after the fight, you heal and generate ult charge for yourself.<br/>I dont even play mercy and I know this much<br/><br/><em><strong>Forum Moderator Note:</strong> I’m going to lock this thread.
