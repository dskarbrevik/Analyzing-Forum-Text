# User Lifecycle Prediction in Gaming Community Forums

W266 Course Project
David Skarbrevik


Main features of this repo currently:
* **"final_paper.pdf"** is the white paper of this project.

* **WebScrapping.ipynb** has a class I made to gather data from Blizzard's forum sites. Blizzard uses the same html formatting for all their different forum sites so coding the scraping for one forum is pretty much coding for all their forums.

* **Overwatch_Forum_Analysis.ipynb** indepth processing and EDA of data that was scrapped from the WebScrapping notebook.
