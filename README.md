# User Lifecycle Prediction in Gaming Community Forums

W266 Course Project
David Skarbrevik


Main features of this repo currently:
* **"final_paper.pdf"** is the white paper of this project.

* **WebScrapping.ipynb** has a class I made to gather data from Blizzard's forum sites. Blizzard uses the same html formatting for all their different forum sites so coding the scraping for one forum is pretty much coding for all their forums.

* **EDA_on_SC2.ipynb** has some veeeery basic eda I have performed on the data. This gives a feel for what data I have. It also changes the date feature into a Pandas date object so the DataFrame can be sliced by date ranges easily. This will be immensely useful when I'm developing the "snapshot models" of the work that inspired this project.
