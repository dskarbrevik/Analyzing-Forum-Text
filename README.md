You can read my corresponding [white paper](/final_paper.pdf) on this project.

Or alternatively explore my analysis in this [main jupyter notebook](/Overwatch_Forum_Analysis.ipynb).

### Main features of this repo currently:
* **"final_paper.pdf"** is the white paper of this project.

* **WebScrapping.ipynb** has a python class I made to gather data from Blizzard's forum sites. Blizzard uses the same html formatting for all their different forum sites so coding the scraping for one forum is pretty much coding for all their forums.

* **Overwatch_Forum_Analysis.ipynb** indepth processing and EDA of Overwatch forum posts.
