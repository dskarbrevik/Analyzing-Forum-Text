I always thought I was easy to counter, and had a very particular place in the game and had to be vigilant to win, now I don’t even see a reason to play the character at all. I feel like the character simply has no power anymore.<br/><br/>Although I hate anecdotes, i think what I just had happen to me sums up the problem with Mercy.<br/><br/>Playing anubis defense, enemy pushes and catches 3 guys (lucio zarya hanzo) in grav. I have rez and valk ready so I pop valk and begin group healing. Enemy team kills them with combined fire (no ults) and... I’m left floating there. <br/><br/>Rez is a death sentance unless you’re protected <br/>Guardian angel has no speed boost so no use kiting around the enemy.<br/>Theres no one to heal, and even if there was it wouldn’t be enough.<br/>Damage boost is doubly useless; healing should almost always take priority anyway.<br/>And I have a really meh pistol with infinite ammo.<br/><br/>So for the next 14 seconds I had a riviting experience knowing how the ducks felt like in Duck Hunt by flying in a circle to contest the objective.<br/><br/>I seriously just don’t get it. Mercy has always been vulnerable on the ground, she just as vulnerable in the air, what used to be risky plays had their rewards taken away from them, and she has the lowest damage of all supports. I just don’t see any specific reason to play the character. Rez right now is just a convenience, it helps somone not have to walk all the way from spawn when your team has control of the situation or the enemy is too incompentant to stop you.</div> </div>\n",

Either by making them a near requirement to be on a team or making the game play revolve around that single player's performance. <br/><br/>Mercy is balanced now being she no longer has the most impact (by a wide margin) on the battle field. I can understand people might not like how that was achieved but it needed to be done. The debate is more about how it was done vs the need to do it. <br/>Hunt the mercy game play was mind numbing boring for 10 out of 12 players on the server. Even more so if you were a limited range or mobility hero. Then if you did kill Mercy your team had 10 to 20 seconds of no Mercy time to do something team wise. Unless it's point B on 2CP then it did not mater being killing her too soon was just as bad as killing her too late. <br/><br/>I get Mercy mains enjoyed having so much impact while not really having to do all that much. Yet it's rare that any game rewards such low effort with such a massive reward. I can't even think of anything that even comes close outside of the some of the old DM games and even then it was not a hero but a weapon. As in the Redeemer in UT2k4 (guided tactical nuke) or say the BFG10k in Quake.</div> </div>\n",

Either by making them a near requirement to be on a team or making the game play revolve around that single player's performance. <br/><br/>Mercy is balanced now being she no longer has the most impact (by a wide margin) on the battle field. I can understand people might not like how that was achieved but it needed to be done. The debate is more about how it was done vs the need to do it. <br/>Hunt the mercy game play was mind numbing boring for 10 out of 12 players on the server. Even more so if you were a limited range or mobility hero. Then if you did kill Mercy your team had 10 to 20 seconds of no Mercy time to do something team wise. Unless it's point B on 2CP then it did not mater being killing her too soon was just as bad as killing her too late. <br/><br/>I get Mercy mains enjoyed having so much impact while not really having to do all that much. Yet it's rare that any game rewards such low effort with such a massive reward. I can't even think of anything that even comes close outside of the some of the old DM games and even then it was not a hero but a weapon. As in the Redeemer in UT2k4 (guided tactical nuke) or say the BFG10k in Quake.</blockquote><br/><br/>Playing mercy is high reward for everyone involved because she is the games only [i]pure[i] healer. By that i mean she isn't designed with some DPS gimmick in mind like the other supports. Also, your're insinuating that her play style is easy, and free of risk which is severely inaccurate.</div> </div>\n",

       " <div class=\"TopicPost-bodyContent\" data-topic-post-body-content=\"true\"><blockquote>Playing anubis defense, enemy pushes and <strong>catches 3 guys</strong> (lucio zarya hanzo) in grav. I have rez and valk ready <strong>so I pop valk and begin group healing</strong>. Enemy team kills them with combined fire (no ults) and... I’m left floating there. <br/><br/>Rez is a death sentance unless you’re protected <br/>Guardian angel has no speed boost so no use kiting around the enemy.<br/>Theres no one to heal, and even if there was it wouldn’t be enough.<br/><strong>Damage boost is doubly useless</strong>; healing should almost always take priority anyway.<br/>And I have a really meh pistol with infinite ammo.</blockquote>Im not gonna address everything you said, but based on the two bolded statements, I think you're just using her wrong.<br/><br/>You're trying to hammer through a situation with a screwdriver. Valk isn't a defensive ult, using it into a Grav was just asking to be punished. The truth is, Mercy has been OP for a long time, and you need to actually learn to play the character now. Valk is versatile, it can help sustain your team over a long fight or it can combo offensively. <br/> <br/>Combo Valk with Dragonblade for example. Damage boost from Valk allows Genji to swing and dash to kill 200 HP heros, and the pressure he creates provides safety for you. Your enhanced range means you can boost him from a safe distance no matter where he goes.</div> </div>\n",

Valk shouldn't counter Grav anyways, seeing as how if it did, zenyatta would be pointless. You, as mercy, have much more utility in your ult than other supports, being able to swap to a team wide damage boost and back without hesitation.<br/><br/>I think what you're missing is that Valk is no longer the reactionary ult that it once was. Use it more proactively in the fight, to ensure a healing and damage edge for your team, rather than saving it for when things get hairy.<br/><br/>And Mercy is still a really good pick on any map where Pharah is good. That combo hasn't changed in strength. Just pick her in the right situations, and recognize that her ult, though much weaker than it was before, is in a better place for the health of the game.<br/><br/>I'm sure she'll see some small tweaks, quality of life stuff, in the coming months to make her feel better.</div> </div>\n",
